I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [Ecole d'Actuariat](https://www.fsg.ulaval.ca/departements/ecole-dactuariat){:target="_blank"} - [Université Laval](https://www.ulaval.ca/){:target="_blank"} (Québec, Canada). Before that, I completed a PhD in Mathematics and Modeling at [UMR MISTEA](https://eng-mistea.montpellier.hub.inrae.fr/){:target="_blank"} - [INRAE](https://www.inrae.fr/en){:target="_blank"}, [Université de Montpellier](https://www.umontpellier.fr/en/){:target="_blank"} (Montpellier, France). I defended my thesis on October 10th, 2025 (see [manuscript](https://hal.science/tel-05325824v1){:target="_blank"} and [slides in French](/files/Soutenance_de_these_Vweb.pdf){:target="_blank"}).


Research interests
------
In general, I am interested in how mathematics can contribute to other fields of scientific research, especially natural sciences (physics, biology) and their applications, such as environment, health, energy, resources management. I aspire to tackle questions from these applied topics, that may be described through mathematical models, and for which one can seek to develop mathematical theory leading to scientific advances. I am particularly interested in developing strategies of resource management for complex systems that are exposed to uncertain (potentially extreme) events.

My PhD focused on <strong>crop irrigation decision support tools</strong>, based on the optimization of analytical and numerical models, in a context of climate change and preservation of water resources, integrating <strong>deficit irrigation</strong> framework and <strong>weather uncertainties</strong>. I conducted a <strong>double modeling</strong> approach, developing theoretical properties from a mathematical model suited to <strong>optimal control theory</strong>, and interacting with the simulation model <strong>[Optirrig](https://www.g-eau.fr/index.php/en/productions/software/item/1036-optirrig-generation-analyse-et-optimisation-de-scenarios-d-irrigation-pour-les-cultures)</strong> for operational purposes. This approach opens up multiple directions for further investigation, such as <strong>agrivoltaic systems</strong>, <strong>fertigation</strong> or <strong>large scale irrigation</strong>.
