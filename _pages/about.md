I am currently a research engineer at [UMR G-EAU](https://www.g-eau.fr/index.php/en/){:target="_blank"} - [INRAE](https://www.inrae.fr/en){:target="_blank"}. Before that, I completed a PhD in Applied Mathematics at [UMR MISTEA](https://eng-mistea.montpellier.hub.inrae.fr/){:target="_blank"} - INRAE, Université de Montpellier (France), supervised by [Alain Rapaport](https://sites.google.com/site/alainrapaport/){:target="_blank"} (MISTEA), [Sébastien Roux](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sebastien-Roux-2){:target="_blank"} (MISTEA) and [Bruno Cheviron](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bruno-Cheviron){:target="_blank"} (G-EAU). I defended my thesis on October 10th, 2025 (see [manuscript](https://hal.science/tel-05325824v1){:target="_blank"} and [slides (in French)](/files/Soutenance_de_these_Vweb.pdf){:target="_blank"}).


Research interests
------
I am interested in how mathematics can contribute to other fields of scientific research, especially natural sciences (physics, biology) and their applications, such as environment, health, energy, resources management. In other words, I aspire to tackle questions from these applied topics, that may be transposed into mathematical formalism, and for which one can seek to develop mathematical theory leading to scientific advances.

My PhD focused on <strong>crop irrigation decision support tools</strong>, based on the optimization of analytical and numerical models, in a context of climate change and preservation of water resources. The motivation was to provide a real-time decision, integrating seasonal management <strong>constraints</strong> and <strong>weather uncertainties</strong>. I conducted a <strong>double modeling</strong> approach that consisted in developing theoretical properties from a mathematical model suited to <strong>optimal control theory</strong>, and interacting with the simulation model <strong>[Optirrig](https://www.g-eau.fr/index.php/en/productions/software/item/1036-optirrig-generation-analyse-et-optimisation-de-scenarios-d-irrigation-pour-les-cultures)</strong> for operational purposes.

Current works
------
I am currently working on a new related project, dealing with <strong>agrivoltaic</strong> systems. I investigate the problem of managing simultaneously the irrigation schedule and the operation of photovoltaic panels, and I develop decision strategies for optimization purposes.
